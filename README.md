### Sublime_text

What is it: A text editor, I'm pretty sure that's it. It's like notepad. There are indeed plugins, but honestly. It's not as smooth as vscode.

#### Download it

### Jupyter_notebook

What is it: It looks like a text editor, but it's actually a way to compile code, you can view plots as you write code. Neat stuff.

#### How to launch

This one is a bit of a time. You need to install it first, then you can launch it from the command line with:

``` bash
jupyter notebook <filename>
```

which will initiate a notebook session in the same directory.
